Hello! My name is Jack Komaroff and I am a junior at Horace Mann. I am currently taking Feingold's Art of Data course and will be sharing my progress through this website. Thanks for taking a look at my code!

### My Coding Journey

I started coding in 4th grade and began with **HTML**.
I then started working with **Java** in Mr. Lee's CS2 course and we briefly started **Python**.
Over the summer of 9th grade I learned **C** and **Arduino** code during an Internet of Things and Connected Devices course at NYU Tisch School of Engineering.
This year is my formal introduction to **Python** and I am loving the coding language and the Art of Data course.
